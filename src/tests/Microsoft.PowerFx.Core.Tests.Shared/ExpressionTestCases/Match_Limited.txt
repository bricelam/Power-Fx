#SETUP: RegEx

// For conssitent regular expressions across hosts, these tests check that we are 
// limiting .NET regular expresions to what we can also support in JavaScript with XRegExp
// See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/regular-expression-options#ecmascript-matching-behavior
// We run without the RegexOptions.ECMASScript because we want Unicode letters for words

// Unicode letters as word characters is allowed

>> Match( "the whole world", "\b(\w+\s*)+" )
{FullMatch:"the whole world",StartMatch:1,SubMatches:Table({Value:"world"})}

>> Match( "целый мир", "\b(\w+\s*)+" )

>> Match( "el niño", "\b(\w+\s*)+" )
{FullMatch:"el niño",StartMatch:1,SubMatches:Table({Value:"niño"})}
